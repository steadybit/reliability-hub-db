# Introduction
Validates whether you deploy Kubernetes resources via rolling updates to prevent downtime when deploying a new version.

# Supported Advice States
## Action Needed
The advice automatically discovers whether you configured your Kubernetes deployments `spec.strategy` to `RollingUpdate`. The discovery is performed by the open-source library [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) and integrated into this advice.


## Validation Needed
Not supported.

## Implemented
Once the Kubernetes deployment `spec.strategy` type is properly configured for `RollingUpdate`

# Disabling Advice
Every advice is automatically active as described in [extension-kubernetes#configuration](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes/?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).
You can also activate advice individually, using for this advice, the identifier `com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.advice.k8s-deployment-strategy`.
