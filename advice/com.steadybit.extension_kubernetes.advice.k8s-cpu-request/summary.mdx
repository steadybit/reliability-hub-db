# Introduction
Validates whether you request reasonable CPU for your Kubernetes resources.
The requested resources of a pod's container inform Kubernetes' decision on where to schedule a pod.

# Supported Advice States

## Validation Needed
Asks you to confirm that you've configured the requested CPU reasonable to the best of our knowledge and belief.

## Implemented
Once the Kubernetes container's specification `resources.requests.cpu` configures a value that was marked as validated.
