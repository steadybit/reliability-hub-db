# Introduction
Validates whether you prevent multiple pods from being deployed on the same node in the cluster to increase availability in case one node becomes unavailable. Otherwise, a single node outage may cause an entire deployment/stateful set to become unavailable.

# Supported Advice States
## Action Needed
The advice automatically discovers whether a Kubernetes workload resource spreads pods across nodes via a `podAntiAffinity` rule. The discovery is performed by the open-source library [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) and integrated into this advice.

## Validation Needed
Not supported.

## Implemented
Once you have configured Kubernetes to spread the pods across different nodes.

# Disabling Advice
Every advice is automatically active as described in [extension-kubernetes#configuration](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes/?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).
You can also activate advice individually, using for this advice, the identifier `com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.advice.k8s-host-podantiaffinity`.
