# Introduction
Validates usage of explicit container image versioning and avoids the `:latest`-tag.

# Supported Advice States
## Action Needed
The advice automatically discovers whether you configured your container of a Kubernetes resource to an explicit version to enable version downgrades and ease debugging. The discovery is performed by the open-source library [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) and integrated into this advice.


## Validation Needed
Not supported.

## Implemented
Once the Kubernetes resources' container use a fixed and explicit version.

# Disabling Advice
Every advice is automatically active as described in [extension-kubernetes#configuration](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes/?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).
You can also activate advice individually, using for this advice, the identifier `com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.advice.k8s-image-latest-tag`.
