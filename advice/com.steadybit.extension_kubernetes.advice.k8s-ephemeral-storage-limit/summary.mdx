# Introduction
Validates whether you limit the maximum allowed ephemeral storage for your Kubernetes resources. Limiting ephemeral storage prevents utilizing the entire available disk space, which may cause stability issues for other Kubernetes resources.

# Supported Advice States
## Action Needed
Automatically discovers whether all Kubernetes container's `resources.limits.ephemeral-storage` are configured. The discovery is performed by the open-source library [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) and integrated into this advice.

## Validation Needed
Asks you to validate with an automatically created experiment that provided features work as expected, fail gracefully, workload resources scale up or monitoring alerts while consuming a lot of ephemeral storage.

If the target is associated with a service, the experiment automatically includes a service validation step. This makes it easy to judge whether the service behaves as expected from a user’s perspective.

If you do not use Steadybit’s service feature, you can require the user to provide additional validations via a wizard when creating the experiment.
For that, you need to tag your Kubernetes targets with the label `tags.steadybit.com/service-validation` and one of the following values:

* `http`: Run an HTTP check on a `GET` endpoint
* `k6`: Run a k6 load test
* `gatling`: Run a Gatling load test
* `jmeter`: Run a JMeter load test

If none of these options apply, the experiment will include a `TODO` step prompting you to add custom validation logic for your service.

## Implemented
Once the Kubernetes container's specification `resources.limits.ephemeral-storage` configures a value that was marked as validated.

# Disabling Advice
Every advice is automatically active as described in [extension-kubernetes#configuration](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes/?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).
You can also activate advice individually, using for this advice, the identifier `com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.advice.k8s-ephemeral-storage-limit`.
