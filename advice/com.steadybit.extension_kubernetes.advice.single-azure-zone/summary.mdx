# Introduction
Validate whether, right now, multiple pods of the same workload resource are deployed in the same Azure Availability Zone to avoid downtime whenever one zone isn't available.

# Supported Advice States
## Action Needed
The advice automatically discovers whether a Kubernetes workload resource, right now,  spreads pods across Azure Availability Zones, e.g., via a `podAntiAffinity` rule.

## Validation Needed
Not supported.

## Implemented
Once you have configured Kubernetes to spread the pods across different Azure availability zones.
