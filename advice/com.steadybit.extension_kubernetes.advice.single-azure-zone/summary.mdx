# Introduction
Validate whether, right now, multiple pods of the same workload resource are deployed in the same Azure Availability Zone to avoid downtime whenever one zone isn't available.

# Supported Advice States
## Action Needed
The advice automatically discovers whether a Kubernetes workload resource, right now,  spreads pods across Azure Availability Zones, e.g., via a `podAntiAffinity` rule.

## Validation Needed
Asks you to validate with an automatically created experiment that your provided service works while one availability zone is simulated to go down.
The experiment will block traffic to a container in one zone, which should be detected by Kubernetes via the configured liveness probe, causing Kubernetes to restart the container and eventually redirect traffic once it is up and running again.

By default, the experiment contains a TODO step to add validation logic for your service. We highly recommend resolving this step to facilitate the discussion of whether your service works as expected from a user's point of view.
You can also tag your Kubernetes Deployment with the label `tags.steadybit.com/service-validation` to support different validations:

* `http`: For an HTTP check on a GET endpoint
* `k6`: For running a k6 load test
* `gatling`: For running a Gatling load test
* `jmeter`: For running a JMeter load test

Once you create the experiment, the user is asked to specify the corresponding validation, and Steadybit runs it throughout the experiment.

## Implemented
Once you have configured Kubernetes to spread the pods across different Azure availability zones.

# Disabling Advice
Every advice is automatically active as described in [extension-kubernetes#configuration](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes/?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).
You can also activate advice individually, using for this advice, the identifier `com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.advice.single-azure-zone`.
