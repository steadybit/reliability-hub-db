# Introduction
Validates whether you have configured liveness and readiness probes for deployments targeted by Kubernetes services. Kubernetes wouldn't be able to route traffic properly without these probes.

# Supported Advice States
## Action Needed
The advice automatically discovers whether all Kubernetes containers that are part of a workload resource targeted by a Kubernetes service, have configured a `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe`. The discovery is performed by the open-source library [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) and integrated into this advice.

## Validation Needed
Asks you to validate with an automatically created experiment that provided liveness and readiness probes are working as expected.
The experiment will block traffic to one container, which should be detected by Kubernetes via the configured liveness probe, causing Kubernetes to restart the container and eventually redirect traffic once it is marked as ready again based on the configured readiness probe.

If the target is associated with a service, the experiment automatically includes a service validation step. This makes it easy to judge whether the service behaves as expected from a user’s perspective.

If you do not use Steadybit’s service feature, you can require the user to provide additional validations via a wizard when creating the experiment.
For that, you need to tag your Kubernetes targets with the label `tags.steadybit.com/service-validation` and one of the following values:

* `http`: Run an HTTP check on a `GET` endpoint
* `k6`: Run a k6 load test
* `gatling`: Run a Gatling load test
* `jmeter`: Run a JMeter load test

If none of these options apply, the experiment will include a `TODO` step prompting you to add custom validation logic for your service.

## Implemented
Once the Kubernetes container's specifications `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe` are configured and validated with the suggested experiment.

# Disabling Advice
Every advice is automatically active as described in [extension-kubernetes#configuration](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes/?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration). You can also activate advice individually, using for this advice, the identifier `com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.advice.k8s-probes`.
