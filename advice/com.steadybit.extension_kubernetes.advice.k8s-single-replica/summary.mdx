# Introduction
Prevent your deployment from being down by having at least two pods or an automatic scaling via HorizontalPodAutoscaler. Otherwise, e.g., a single failure in a pod, crashing host, or availability zone being down would cause unavailability of a deployment.

# Supported Advice States
## Action Needed
The advice automatically discovers whether a Kubernetes deployment has at least two pods configured, e.g., via `spec.replicas` or HorizontalPodAutoscaler. The discovery is performed by the open-source library [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) and integrated into this advice.

## Validation Needed
Asks you to validate with an automatically created experiment that provided features work as expected when a container of a single pod is restarting.

By default, the experiment contains a TODO step to add validation logic for your service. We highly recommend resolving this step to facilitate the discussion of whether your service works as expected from a user's point of view.
You can also tag your Kubernetes Deployment with the label `tags.steadybit.com/service-validation` to support different validations:

* `http`: For an HTTP check on a GET endpoint
* `k6`: For running a k6 load test
* `gatling`: For running a Gatling load test
* `jmeter`: For running a JMeter load test

Once you create the experiment, the user is asked to specify the corresponding validation, and Steadybit runs it throughout the experiment.

## Implemented
Once you have configured Kubernetes to have at least two pods or the deployment is targeted by a HorizontalPodAutoscaler.

# Disabling Advice
Every advice is automatically active as described in [extension-kubernetes#configuration](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes/?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).
You can also activate advice individually, using for this advice, the identifier `com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.advice.k8s-single-replica`.
