# Introduction
Prevent multiple pods from being deployed in the same AWS Availability Zone to avoid downtime whenever one zone isn't available.

# Supported Advice States
## Action Needed
The advice automatically discovers whether a Kubernetes workload resource spreads pods across AWS Availability Zones, e.g., via a `podAntiAffinity` rule. The discovery is performed by the open-source library [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) and integrated into this advice.

## Validation Needed
Not supported.

## Implemented
Once you have configured Kubernetes to spread the pods across different AWS availability zones.

# Disabling Advice
Every advice is automatically active as described in [extension-kubernetes#configuration](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes/?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).
You can also activate advice individually, using for this advice, the identifier `com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.advice.single-aws-zone`.
