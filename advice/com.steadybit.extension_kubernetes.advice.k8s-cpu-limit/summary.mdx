# Introduction
Validates whether you limit the maximum allowed CPU usage for your Kubernetes resources. Limiting CPU usage prevents utilizing the entire available CPU, which may cause stability issues for other Kubernetes resources.

# Supported Advice States
## Action Needed
Automatically discovers whether all Kubernetes container's `resources.limits.cpu` are configured. The discovery is performed by the open-source library [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) and integrated into this advice.

## Validation Needed
Asks you to validate with an automatically created experiment that provided features work as expected, fail gracefully, workload resources scale up or monitoring alerts while consuming a lot of CPU.

## Implemented
Once the Kubernetes container's specification `resources.limits.cpu` configures a value that was marked as validated.

# Disabling Advice
Every advice is automatically active as described in [extension-kubernetes#configuration](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes/?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).
You can also activate advice individually, using for this advice, the identifier `com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.advice.k8s-cpu-limit`.
