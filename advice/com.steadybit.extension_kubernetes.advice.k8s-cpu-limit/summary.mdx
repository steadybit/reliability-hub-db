# Introduction
Validates whether you limit the maximum allowed CPU usage for your Kubernetes resources. Limiting CPU usage prevents utilizing the entire available CPU, which may cause stability issues for other Kubernetes resources.

# Supported Advice States
## Action Needed
Automatically discovers whether all Kubernetes container's `resources.limits.cpu` are configured. The discovery is performed by the open-source library [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) and integrated into this advice.

## Validation Needed
Asks you to validate with an automatically created experiment that provided features work as expected, fail gracefully, workload resources scale up or monitoring alerts while consuming a lot of CPU.

By default, the experiment contains a TODO step to add validation logic for your service. We highly recommend resolving this step to facilitate the discussion of whether your service works as expected from a user's point of view.
You can also tag your Kubernetes Deployment with the label `tags.steadybit.com/service-validation` to support different validations:

* `http`: For an HTTP check on a GET endpoint
* `k6`: For running a k6 load test
* `gatling`: For running a Gatling load test
* `jmeter`: For running a JMeter load test

## Implemented
Once the Kubernetes container's specification `resources.limits.cpu` configures a value that was marked as validated.

# Disabling Advice
Every advice is automatically active as described in [extension-kubernetes#configuration](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes/?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).
You can also activate advice individually, using for this advice, the identifier `com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.advice.k8s-cpu-limit`.
