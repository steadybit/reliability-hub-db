# Intent
Verify that New Relic alerts you on disruptions in your New Relic workflow such as a critical deployment having no pods ready to serve traffic.

# Motivation
Kubernetes features a liveness probe to determine whether your pod is healthy and able to accept traffic.
If Kubernetes is unable to probe a pod, it is restarting it in the hope to get it ready eventually.
In case it is a critical deployment, New Relic workflow should alert on this disrutpion

# Structure
First, check that the New Relic Workflow is marked as operational
As soon as all pods of a deployment aren't reachable, caused by the Steadybit attack [block traffic](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_container.network_blackhole), New Relic should detect this by marking the workflow as disrupted and ensuring your on-call team is taking action.

# Environment Example

The Kubernetes deployment `gateway` consists of two pods.
We are attacking both pods and wait for New Relic to detect the disrupted New Relic workflow.
