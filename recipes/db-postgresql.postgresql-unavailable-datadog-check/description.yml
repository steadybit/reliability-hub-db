label: Verify system unavailability status during PostgreSQL downtime
description: An unavailable database should be handled by your application gracefully and being indicated appropriately. Specifically, we want to ensure that at least one monitor in Datadog is alerting us to the outage. You can address a potential impact on your system by implementing e.g. a failover or caching mechanism.
