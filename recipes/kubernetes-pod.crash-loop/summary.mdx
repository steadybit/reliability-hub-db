# Intent
Verify that your monitoring solution alerts you on pods not being ready to accept traffic for a certain amount of time.

# Motivation

Kubernetes features a readiness probe to determine whether your pod is ready to accept traffic.
If it isn't becoming ready, Kubernetes tries to solve it by restarting the underlying container and hoping to achieve its readiness eventually.
If this isn't working, Kubernetes will eventually back off to restart the container, and the Kubernetes resource remains non-functional.


# Structure

First, check that your monitor is in an 'okay' state and doesn't alert on non-ready containers.
As soon as one of the containers is crash looping, caused by the Steadybit attack [crash loop](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.crash_loop_pod), a specific monitor should alert to achieve your on-call team is taking action.

# Environment Example

The Kubernetes deployment `gateway` consists of two pods.
We are attacking one of the two pods by causing a crash loop and waiting on a specific monitor in Datadog to detect this crashing pod.
