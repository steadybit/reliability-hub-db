# Intent
Ensure that all containers of Kubernetes workload resources have proper ephemeral storage limits configured to prevent instability of other containers.

# Motivation
For an elastic and resilient cloud infrastructure, ensure that the over-usage of ephemeral storage of one container doesn't affect any others.
Furthermore, if one container exceeds its configured limits, it should be killed by Kubernetes and eventually get ready within a given timeframe.

# Structure
For the duration of the experiment and the exceeding of the ephemeral storage, verify that an offered user-visible endpoint is responding within expected success rates.
As soon as one container exceeds the ephemeral storage, by filling the disk in a `/tmp` directory, Kubernetes should evict the container, decreasing ready pods. Within 60 seconds, the evicted container should run again, and the pod should be ready.

# Environment Example
In our example, we are filling the ephemeral storage of the gateway, which has a limit of 1GB. Furthermore, we expect the new pod to be ready within 60 seconds.
