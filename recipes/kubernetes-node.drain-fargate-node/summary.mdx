# Intent
When draining a Fargate node, it is beneficial for reliability to spawn a new Fargate node instead of waiting to complete the drain.

# Motivation
When draining a Fargate node, Kubernetes should remove the node immediately from the cluster.
To avoid overutilizing existing nodes, AWS should spawn a new node that joins the cluster.
Eventually, all pods should be again ready using that newly spawned node.

# Structure

For the duration of the node spawning, verify that an offered user-visible endpoint is responding within expected success rates.
Before draining the node, all pods should be ready, and when draining one Fargate node, the total node count of the cluster should decrease.
Within a given duration, a new node should join the cluster, and eventually, all pods shall be ready again as well.


# Environment Example

In our example, we check for a user-visible endpoint of the gateway-deployment while draining a node.
For node eviction and spawning, we assume a maximum timeout of 90 seconds and for all pods to be ready 60 seconds.
