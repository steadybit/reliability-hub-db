# Intent
Verify that Datadog monitor alerts you on pods not being ready to accept traffic for a certain amount of time.

# Motivation

Kubernetes features a readiness probe to determine whether your pod is ready to accept traffic.
If it isn't becoming ready, Kubernetes tries to solve it by restarting the underlying container and hoping to achieve its readiness eventually.
If this isn't working, Kubernetes will eventually back off to restart the container, and the Kubernetes resource remains non-functional.


# Structure

First, check that Datadog monitor responsible for tracking non-ready container is in an 'okay' state.
As soon as one of the containers is crash looping, caused by the Steadybit attack [crash loop](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.crash_loop_pod), the Datadog monitor should alert and escalate it to your on-call team.

# Environment Example

The Kubernetes deployment `gateway` consists of two pods.
We are attacking one of the two pods by causing a crash loop and waiting on a specific monitor in Datadog to detect this crashing pod.
