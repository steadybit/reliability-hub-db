# Introduction

Use this action to up or downscale a Kubernetes deployment.
The attack scales the deployment to the specified replica count at the beginning of the attack and rolls it back to the old replica count whenever the attack stops.
Intermediate changes of the replica count, i.e., by third-party tools, don't cause a re-scaling by the attack.

# Use Cases
- Verify that your deployment is successfully scaled up and the new pod is taken into account by your load balancer
- Check how long it takes to scale your deployment to a desirable amount of pods (in combination with a [pod count check](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.pod_count_check))


# Parameters

| Name          | Required | Description                            | Default |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| Duration      | true     | How long should the new scale be used? | 180s    |
| Replica Count | true     | The desired replica count              | 1       |

# Rollback
At the end of the attack or in case of an error, the old desired replica count will be restored.
