# Introduction

When executing chaos experiments, you may want to check if problems in Dynatrace are popping up. Or the opposite.

The problem check step can be dragged&dropped into the experiment editor.
Once done, you can use it to collect information about the state of the Dynatrace problems and, optionally, to verify that they are within the expected condition.

Experiments can be aborted and marked as failed when the Problem check's actual state diverges from the expected state.
This helps to implement pre-/post-conditions and invariants.
For example, to only start an experiment when the system is healthy.

At last, to help you understand the problems' status and how they evolved, the run view also contains a status visualization.
Through this visualization, you can see what states the Dynatrace's problems contained throughout the experiment execution.


# Use Cases

 - Pre-/postcondition or invariant for any experiment.
 - Verify that problems are triggered during incidents.

| Parameter            | Description                                                                    | Default                      |
| ---------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Duration             | How long should steadybit check for problems?                                  | 30s                          |
| Condition            | If you pick a condition, the experiment will fail if the condition is not met. | No check, only show problems |
| Condition Check Mode | How often should the status be expected. "At least once" or "All the time"     | "All the time"               |
