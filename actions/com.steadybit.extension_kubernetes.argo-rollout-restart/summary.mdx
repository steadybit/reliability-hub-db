# Introduction

This attack triggers a restart of an Argo Rollout by patching the `spec.restartAt` field with the current timestamp. This causes the Argo Rollouts controller to perform a rolling restart of all pods managed by the rollout, similar to how `kubectl argo rollouts restart` works.

# Use Cases

 - Check that a service remains available during an Argo Rollout restart, e.g., with the help of rolling updates or canary strategies.
 - Verify how upstream services behave during a restart of downstream services managed by Argo Rollouts.
 - Validate that traffic management (e.g., canary or blue-green routing) continues to function correctly during a pod restart.
 - See whether persistent connections to a restarting service get re-established.

# Parameters
