# Introduction

You can use the haproxy ingress block traffic action to block all traffic to specific HTTP path / HTTP Method / HTTP Headers in the ingress controller and give back specific http status. This is useful for testing how your application behaves when specific endpoints are not reachable.

# Use Cases

* Understand how your services behave under network outages

# Usage

You can apply multiple actions to the same ingress resource.

# Rollback

The annotation made to the ingress resource will be removed automatically after the action is finished. If you want to rollback manually, you can look for the annotation `haproxy-ingress.github.io/backend-config-snippet` in the ingress resource and remove the parts that are surrounded by `# BEGIN STEADYBIT -` and `# END STEADYBIT -`. The steadybit parts in the annotation will be removed automatically after the action is finished.

# Parameters

Path Pattern, HTTP Method, and HTTP Headers are optional parameters. If you do not set them, nothing will be blocked. If you set them, all requests that match the path pattern, HTTP method, and HTTP headers will be blocked.
