# Introduction

Stress the CPU of an ECS task.

# Details

This attack will run the AWSFIS-Run-CPU-Stress SSM Document on the target ECS task using the SSM agent.

# Use Cases

Test the behavior of the ECS task when the CPU is under high load.

    * Will the application crash? Does it recover from the high load?
    * Does the auto-scaling work as expected?
    * Does the load balancing care for busy workers?
    * Is your alerting properly configured?

# Prerequisites

    * [The ECS task must have the SSM agent installed and running.](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-aws/blob/main/README-ecs-ssm-setup.md)
    * The ECS task must use the Linux runtime platform
    * The ECS taks must not have the `execute-command` feature enabled

# Rollback

The issued SSM command running on the SSM agent will be cancelled and the cpu stress will be stopped.

# Parameters

| Parameter             | Description                                        | Default    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Load on Container CPU | How much CPU load should be inflicted?             | 100%       |
| Container CPUs        | How many workers should be used to stress the CPU? | 1 per core |
| Duration              | How long should the CPU be stressed?               | 30s        |
