# Introduction

The Alert Check step can be dragged&dropped into the experiment editor. Once done, you can use it to verify if an Alert has been fired, or not, during the execution time.

Experiments can be aborted and marked as failed when the Alert Check's actual state diverges from the expected one. This helps implement pre-/post-conditions and invariants. For example, to only start an experiment when the system is healthy.

At last, to help you understand the Alert states and how they evolved, the run view also contains a state visualization. Through this visualization, you can see during which time an Alert was fired.

# Use Cases

 - Pre-/postcondition or invariant for any experiment.
 - Verify that alerts are triggered during incidents.
