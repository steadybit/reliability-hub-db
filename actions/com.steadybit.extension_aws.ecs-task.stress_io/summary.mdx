# Introduction

Stress the IO of an ECS task.

# Details

This attack will run the AWSFIS-Run-IO-stress SSM Document on the target ECS task using the SSM agent.

# Use Cases

Test the behavior of the ECS task when the ephemeral storage experiences IO stress.

    * Applications using the ephemeral storage for caching or temporary storage might fail or have increased latency.
    * Does the application recover from busy disk?
    * Is your alerting properly configured?

# Prerequisites

    * [The ECS task must have the SSM agent installed and running.](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-aws/blob/main/README-ecs-ssm-setup.md)
    * The ECS task must use the Linux runtime platform
    * The ECS taks must not have the `execute-command` feature enabled

# Rollback

The issued SSM command running on the SSM agent will be cancelled and the IO stress will be stoppend and the disk space will be freed.
