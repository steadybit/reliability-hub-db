# Introduction

Inject corrupt packets by introducing single bit error at a random offset into egress network traffic.

# Prerequisites

If you are not using our container images for the extension, you need install the `tc` (from the iproute2 package) tool to use the attack.


# Use Cases

* Testing network resilience to bit errors
