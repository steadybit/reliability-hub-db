# Gatling

[Gatling](https://gatling.io/) is an open-source load- and performance-testing framework based on Scala, Akka and Netty. You can integrate the execution of Gatling load tests directly into your experiments.

### Integrate Custom Load Tests

We base our integration of custom load test on the concept of Docker-images. Therefore, you need a Docker Hub user or a private Docker registry as prerequisite. After that, just follow the steps below to integrate your custom load test:

1. Place your Gatling load test file in a separate folder. We assume for this steps that it is named _custom.scala_. Alternatively, download an example [custom.scala](https://github.com/steadybit/docs-public/blob/main/use-steadybit/actions/gatling-custom.scala) load test and adjust it as needed.
2. Put a Dockerfile into the same directory which simply copies the custom load test into the Docker image. It looks like:

```
# Inherit existing image
FROM steadybit/action-gatling:latest

# Provide custom test
COPY custom.scala /script.js
```

1. Build the docker image and tag it with your own Docker Hub user by running `docker build . --tag <your-docker-hub-huser>/action-gatling:latest`.
2. Login to dockerhub via `docker login`
3. Push the Docker image to Docker Hub Registry via `docker push <your-docker-hub-huser>/action-gatling:latest`
4. In the experiment using the Gatling load test you have to specify `<your-docker-hub-huser>/action-gatling:latest` as _Docker Image_ parameter.

In case the image is not public and requires authentication to be pulled you can configure the Pull-Secrets in the platform via Application Settings -> Agents -> Pull Secrets.

**Tip:** Instead of the dockerhub registry you can also use a custom one - you then need to use a prefixed image tag and the correct login

#### Parameters

Within the Gatling load test you have access to the following parameters as environment variables. You can use them in the script via e.g. `${__ENV.DURATION}` as shown in the attached [custom.scala](https://github.com/steadybit/docs-public/blob/main/use-steadybit/actions/gatling-custom.scala).

| Parameter     | Environment Variable | Description                               | Default                            |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Duration      | DURATION             | How long should the load test run?        | inherited from experiment duration |
| Virtual Users | VUS                  | How many virtual users should be started? | 1                                  |
