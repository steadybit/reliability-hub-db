# Introduction

Fill the disk of an ECS task with random data.

# Details

This attack will run the AWSFIS-Run-Disk-Fill SSM Document on the target ECS task using the SSM agent.

# Use Cases

Test the behavior of the ECS task when the ephemeral storage is full.

    * Applications using the ephemeral storage for caching or temporary storage might fail.
    * Does the application recover from the full disk?
    * Is your alerting properly configured?

# Prerequisites

    * [The ECS task must have the SSM agent installed and running.](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-aws/blob/main/README-ecs-ssm-setup.md)
    * The ECS task must use the Linux runtime platform
    * The ECS taks must not have the `execute-command` feature enabled

# Rollback

The issued SSM command running on the SSM agent will be cancelled and the disk space will be freed.
