# Introduction

This action leverages [steadybit/failure-azure-functions-net](https://github.com/steadybit/failure-azure-functions-net) and the Azure App Configuration to inject latency into an Azure Function.

# Use Cases

- Understand how a azure function behaves when it experiences latency.

# Prerequisites

Azure Function must be using v4 isolated worker model and .NET 8 or higher.

Azure Function must [be wrapped with the Steadybit Injection Middleware](https://github.com/steadybit/failure-azure-functions-net).

Please note that multiple parallel failure injections on the same azure function are not supported.

# Parameters

| Parameter       | Description                                                                       | Default |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Duration        | The duration of the attack.                                                       | 30s     |
| Rate            | The rate of invocations to affect. (100 = all request, 50 = half of all requests) | 100%    |
| Minimum Latency | Minimum latency to inject.                                                        | 500ms   |
| Maximum Latency | Maximum latency to inject.                                                        | 500ms   |
