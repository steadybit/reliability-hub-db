# Introduction

The alert rule check step can be dragged&dropped into the experiment editor. Once done, you can use it to collect information about the state of the Grafana alert rules and, optionally, to verify that they are within the expected state.

Experiments can be aborted and marked as failed when the Grafana alert rule check's actual state diverges from the expected state. This helps implement pre-/post-conditions and invariants. For example, to only start an experiment when the system is healthy.

At last, to help you understand the alert rule states and how they evolved, the run view also contains a state visualization. Through this visualization, you can see what states the Alert rules had throughout the experiment execution.

# Use Cases

 - Pre-/postcondition or invariant for any experiment.
 - Verify that alerts are triggered during incidents.
