# Introduction

This action leverages Azure API to manipulate the state of Azure scale set instances / virtual machines. More specifically, it can reboot, delete, stop or deallocate them.

# Use Cases

- Verify auto-scaling of a Kubernetes node group.
- Understand how pods are shifted across different nodes within a Kubernetes cluster.
- Verify that system services come up on system start.
- Check that your monitoring solution informs you about this occurrence.

# Rollback

Note that this attack does not support any rollback. The attack only transmits the API call, e.g., Stop or Delete virtual machine.
