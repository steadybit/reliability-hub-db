# Introduction

You can use the rollout status check to ensure, among others, that a Kubernetes deployment is ready and operational before injecting chaos. This check is helpful to ensure that the system is in a steady state to avoid false positives.

# Use Cases

 - Check that there are no pending deployments before triggering chaos.
 - Verify that the deployment is ready again after injecting turbulent conditions.

# Rollback

*No rollback necessary.*
