# Introduction

With this action, Steadybit can delete records, you specify the number of last records that needs to be deleted (warning: by last records we are referring to the topic ones, not the consumed ones).

To avoid kafka issues, we recommend to block the consumers of the topic targeted either by a block network or a kafka deny access action and during this time to trigger the delete records action.

# Use Cases

 - While blocking a consumer, delete some records to see how consumer reacts when records are missing or there is a gap in the records consumed.
