# Introduction

With this action, Steadybit can dynamically modify a broker configuration to change the value of the following configuration [num.network.threads](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/broker-configs.html#num-network-threads).

# Details

Kafka restricts large changes to its current configuration. If the requested number of network threads falls outside the permissible range,
the extension applies intermediate adjustments incrementally until the target value is achieved.

# Use Cases

 - Reduce the num.network.threads to limit the brokerâ€™s ability to process network requests.
