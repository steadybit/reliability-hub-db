# Introduction

Generate read/write/flush operation on disks.

# Usage
The resources on a host are shared between containers.
Running a resource attack for a container is executed in the containers cgroup and namespace, but might affect the host's resources and all containers running on it.

# Use Cases

* Stress test the container resources

# Parameters

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                 | Default              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Mode            | Define the operational mode. The attack can stress io either by just flushing disk caches calling `sync()` and/or continually reading and writings temporary files to disk. | read_write_and_flush |
| Duration        | How long should IO be consumed?                                                                                                                                             | 30s                  |
| Workers         | How many workers should continually write, read and remove temporary files? (0 = 1 per core)                                                                                | 1                    |
| Path            | Path where the IO should be inflicted                                                                                                                                       | /                    |
| MBytes to write | How many megabytes should be written per stress operation?                                                                                                                  | 1024                 |
