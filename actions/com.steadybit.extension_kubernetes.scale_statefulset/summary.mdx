# Introduction

Use this action to up or downscale a Kubernetes StatefulSet.
The attack scales the StatefulSet to the specified replica count at the beginning of the attack and rolls it back to the old replica count whenever the attack stops.
Intermediate changes of the replica count, i.e., by third-party tools, don't cause a re-scaling by the attack.

# Use Cases
- Verify that your StatefulSet is successfully scaled up and the new pod is taken into account by your load balancer
- Check how long it takes to scale your StatefulSet to a desirable amount of pods

# Parameters

| Name          | Required | Description                            | Default |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| Duration      | true     | How long should the new scale be used? | 180s    |
| Replica Count | true     | The desired replica count              | 1       |

# Rollback

The old desired replica count will be restored after the action has ended.
