# Introduction

Limits bandwidth for all matching network traffic.

# Prerequisites

If you are not using our container images for the agents, you need install the `tc` (from the iproute2 package) tool to use the attack.

# Use Cases

    * Understand your service's performance under load
    * Test your service's resilience to network attacks
    * Test your service's resilience to decreased bandwidth

# Parameters

| Network Bandwidth | How much traffic should be allowed per second?       | 1024kbit |
| Duration          | How long should the bandwidth be reduced?            | 30s      |
