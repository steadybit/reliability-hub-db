# Introduction

When executing chaos experiments, you may want to check if incidents in New Relic are popping up. Or the opposite.

The incident check step can be dragged&dropped into the experiment editor. The action needs one or more New Relic accounts to be selected as targets.
Once done, you can use it to collect information about the state of the New Relic incidents and, optionally, to verify that they are within the expected condition.

Experiments can be aborted and marked as failed when the incident check's actual state diverges from the expected state.
This helps to implement pre-/post-conditions and invariants.
For example, to only start an experiment when the system is healthy.

# Use Cases

 - Pre-/postcondition or invariant for any experiment.
 - Verify that incidents are triggered during experiments.
