# Introduction

Drops all network traffic (IN/OUT/FORWARDED).

# Details

_Note:_ If you are going to attack containers using network attacks, **all containers in the target's linux network namespace** (e.g. all containers belonging to the same Kubernetes Pod or Replica Set) will be affected. In case you want to target the traffic of a single container in the namespace you can for example use the port parameter to limit the blast radius.


# Use Cases

    * Understand how your services behave under network outages
