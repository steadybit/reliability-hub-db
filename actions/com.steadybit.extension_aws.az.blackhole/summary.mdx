# Introduction

Block all traffic for a selected availability zone.

Steadybit will add a network ACL to every subnet in every VPC in the selected zone.

The Attack won't start if you select a zone, where the agent or the extension is running in.

If you need a more fine-grained control, you can use the [blackhole subnet attack](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_aws.ec2-subnet.blackhole).

# Use Cases
