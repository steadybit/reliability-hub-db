# Introduction

Limits bandwidth for all matching egress network traffic.

# Prerequisites

If you are not using our container images for the extension, you need install the `tc` (from the iproute2 package) tool to use the attack.

# Use Cases

* Understand your service's performance under load
* Test your service's resilience to network attacks
* Test your service's resilience to decreased bandwidth

# Parameters
