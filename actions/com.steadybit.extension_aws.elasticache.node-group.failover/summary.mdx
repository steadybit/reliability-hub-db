This action leverages AWS Elasticache API to trigger an Elasticache Nodegroup failover. This is done by promoting a replica to the primary role.

# Use Cases

- Understand how a service behaves when elasticache nodegroup is performing a failover
- Understand the performance impact when elasticache performs a failover, e.g., cold caches.
