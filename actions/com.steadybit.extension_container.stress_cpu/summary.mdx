# Introduction

Generate CPU load for one or more cores

# Usage
The resources on a host are shared between containers.
Running a resource attack for a container is executed in the containers cgroup, but affects the host's resources and all containers running on it.

# Use Cases

* Test your application's resilience to high CPU load
