# Introduction

You can use the haproxy ingress delay traffic action to delay all traffic to a specific HTTP path in the ingress controller for a given time. This is useful for testing how your application behaves when specific endpoints are slowly reachable.

# Use Cases

* Understand how your services behave under network latency

# Rollback

The annotation made to the ingress resource will be removed automatically after the action is finished. If you want to rollback manually, you can look for the annotation `haproxy-ingress.github.io/backend-config-snippet` in the ingress resource and remove the parts that are surrounded by `# BEGIN STEADYBIT -` and `# END STEADYBIT -`. The steadybit parts in the annotation will be removed automatically after the action is finished.
