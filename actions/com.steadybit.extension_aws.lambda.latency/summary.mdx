# Introduction

This action injects latency into an AWS Lambda function executions.

# Prerequisites

- The target AWS Lambda function must [be wrapped with the failure-lambda library](https://github.com/steadybit/failure-lambda#how-to-install-with-parameter-in-ssm-parameter-store).
- Only one failure injection can be active per Lambda function at a time

# Details

This action uses the [steadybit/failure-lambda](https://github.com/steadybit/failure-lambda) library, a Node.js module that wraps AWS Lambda handlers to enable failure injection.
Failure modes are configured via parameters stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, which are automatically removed after execution completes.

Activation and deactivation of failure modes typically complete within 5 seconds. However, middleware layers or caching mechanisms may extend this duration during both injection and recovery phases.

# Use Cases

- Validate behavior of upstream services and monitoring systems when Lambda functions respond slowly
- Test timeout configurations and latency tolerance across distributed systems

# Parameters

| Parameter       | Description                                                           | Default |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Duration        | Duration of the attack.                                               | 30s     |
| Rate            | Percentage of invocations affected (100 = all invocations, 50 = half) | 100%    |
| Minimum Latency | Minimum latency to inject per invocation                              | 500ms   |
| Maximum Latency | Maximum latency to inject per invocation                              | 500ms   |
