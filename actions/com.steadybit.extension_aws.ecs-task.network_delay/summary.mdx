# Introduction

Inject latency into egress network traffic.

# Details

This attack will run the `AWSFIS-Run-Network-Latency-ECS` SSM document on the target ECS task using the SSM agent.

The network delay attack operates on the IP level and thus may delay by a multiple of the specified amount.

# Use Cases

* Evaluate how your services operate under different network latencies.

# Prerequisites

* [The ECS task must have the SSM agent installed and running.](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-aws/blob/main/README-ecs-ssm-setup.md)
* The ECS task must use the Linux runtime platform
* The ECS task must not have the `execute-command` feature enabled
* The ECS task must have the `enableFaultInjection` feature enabled
* The ECS task must have the `pidMod` property set to `task`
* The ECS task must have the `networkMode` property set to a value other than `bridge`

# Rollback

The network attack will be stopped by cancelling the SSM command running on the SSM agent.

| Network Delay   | Amount of delay to add.                                                                                                         | 500ms   |
| Jitter          | Add random +/-30% jitter to network delay?                                                                                      | false   |
| IP Address/CIDR | Restrict to which IP addresses, CIDR blocks or domain names the traffic is affected. If not specified, all traffic is affected. |         |
