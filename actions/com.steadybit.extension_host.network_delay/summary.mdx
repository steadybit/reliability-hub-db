# Introduction

Inject latency into all matching egress traffic.

# Prerequisites

If you are not using our container images for the extension, you need install the `tc` (from the iproute2 package) tool to use the attack.

# Details

The network delay operates at the ip level and affects single packets (network layer, level 3). Thus, it works for UDP and TCP traffic, and you may encounter HTTP requests that are delayed by a multiple of the specified delay.

In this example the traffic is delayed by 500ms. If you tap the wire (using tcpdump) and feed it into Wireshark it looks like shown in the image above.

1. The first incoming packet initiates the tcp connection and is accepted by the second packet, which is delayed exactly be the 500ms.

2. With the fourth packet we receive an HTTP request in the payload. Which is acknowledged and answered with an HTTP response in packet four to seven, which are also delayed by 500ms and thus the total latency for the HTTP request sums up to 1 second.
