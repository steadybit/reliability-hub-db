# Introduction

Block all traffic for a selected subnet.

This action is similiar to the [blackhole zone attack](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_aws.az.blackhole) but is using a single subnet as a target to allow more fine grained control.

Steadybit will create and assign a network ACL to the selected subnet(s).


# Use Cases

* Understand how your services behave if network is blocked
