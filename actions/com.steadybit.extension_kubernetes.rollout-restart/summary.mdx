# Introduction

The rollout restart attack helps simulate the rollout of a Kubernetes deployment. More specifically, the attack issues a kubectl rollout restart command. This command adds an annotation with the current time to the Kubernetes deployment, which then forces the ReplicaSet to reconcile the state, i.e., update all pods.

# Use Cases

 - Check that a service remains available during rollouts, e.g., with the help of rolling rollouts.
 - Verify how upstream services behave during a rollout of downstream services.
 - Check that load balancer configurations update after updates.
 - See whether persistent connections to a restarting service get re-established.

# Rollback

*No rollback possible.*
