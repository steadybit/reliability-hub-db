# Introduction

Blocks access to DNS servers for a specific duration.

# Details

This attack will run the `AWSFIS-Run-Network-Blackhole-Port-ECS` SSM document on the target ECS task using the SSM agent.

DNS queries to the specified UPD port are blocked. More advanced situation can be handled by the `Block Traffic` attack.

# Use Cases

* Understand how your services behave under DNS outages or failures
* Simulate a DDoS attack on your DNS servers
* Maintenance of the authoritative name servers
* Simulate bad configuration of DNS servers

# Prerequisites

* [The ECS task must have the SSM agent installed and running.](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-aws/blob/main/README-ecs-ssm-setup.md)
* The ECS task must use the Linux runtime platform
* The ECS task must not have the `execute-command` feature enabled
* The ECS task must have the `enableFaultInjection` feature enabled
* The ECS task must have the `pidMod` property set to `task`
* The ECS task must have the `networkMode` property set to a value other than `bridge`

# Rollback

The network attack will be stopped by cancelling the SSM command running on the SSM agent.
