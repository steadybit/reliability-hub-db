# Introduction

Inject corrupt packets by introducing single bit error at a random offset into network traffic.

# Details

_Note:_ If you are going to attack containers using network attacks, **all containers in the target's namespace** (e.g. all containers belonging to the same Kubernetes Pod or Replica Set) will be affected. In case you want to target the traffic of a single container in the namespace you can for example use the port parameter to limit the blast radius.

# Use Cases

* Testing network resilience to bit errors

# Parameters

| Parameter            | Description                                                               | Default |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Package Corruption   | How much of the traffic should be corrupted?                              | 15%     |
| Fail on Host Network | Emit failure when the targeted container is using the host network        | true    |
| Duration             | How long should the traffic be affected?                                  | 30s     |
