# Introduction

[K6](https://k6.io/) is a developer-centric, free and open-source load testing tool built for making performance testing a productive and enjoyable experience. You can integrate the execution of K6 load tests directly into your experiments.

# Details

To use K6 you need to upload your K6-Test-Script. This can be done simply by adding a step of type "Loadtest", choose "K6" as Loadtest-Type and use the provided File-Upload.

Within the K6 load test you have access to your provided parameters as environment variables. You can use them in the script via e.g. `${__ENV.DURATION}` as shown in our basic example below. The parameter `DURATION` is always accessible in your script, it contains the estimated total duration of your experiment, based on the duration of the other steps in seconds.

If you don't know where to start, feel free to use our example. It is a very basic script and will just perform some HTTP-Calls on a specified endpoint.

### Example K6 Loadtest script

```
import http from 'k6/http';
import {check, sleep} from 'k6';

export let options = {
  scenarios: {
    default_test: {
      executor: 'constant-vus',
      vus: `${__ENV.VUS}`,
      duration: `${__ENV.DURATION}s`,
    },
  },
};

export default function () {
  let response = http.get(`${__ENV.TARGETURL}`);
  check(response, { 'status was 200': r => r.status == 200 });
  sleep(1);
}
```
