# Introduction

This action executes a shutdown on the host by issuing the `shutdown` command/syscall (depending on the operating system). You can instruct the action to issue a host restart when desired - in which case the command/syscall will be adapted as necessary.

# Details

## Kubernetes Nodes

If you're using the reboot option on Kubernetes nodes, it might be the case that the host finished rebooting and restarting the containers before the control plane takes notice. You can verify the behaviour of this attack for example by using the uptime command on the hosts.

## Virtual Machines

Note that this action will not differentiate between bare-metal or virtual machines. It will always attempt to shut down/reboot a host using the above-mentioned strategy.
