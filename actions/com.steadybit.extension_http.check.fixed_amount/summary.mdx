# Self signed certificates

If you want to use self-signed certificates, you need to import them into the extension. You can do this by mounting a volume with the certificates and referencing it in `extraVolumeMounts` and `extraVolumes` in the helm chart.
See instructions in the [extension-http documentation](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-http?tab=readme-ov-file#importing-your-own-certificates).
