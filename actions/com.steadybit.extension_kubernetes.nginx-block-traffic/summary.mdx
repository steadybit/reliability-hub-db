# Introduction

You can use the nginx ingress block traffic action to block all traffic to a specific HTTP path / HTTP Method / HTTP Headers in the ingress controller by returning a specific HTTP status code. This is useful for testing how your application behaves when specific endpoints are not reachable.

# Requirements

**Important**: Snippets must be enabled on your NGINX Ingress Controller. This can be done by:
- Adding `--enable-snippets` to the controller arguments
- Or setting the `enable-snippets` ConfigMap option to `true`
- Or for NGINX Ingress Operator: `kubectl patch NginxIngress nginxingress-controller -n nginx-ingress --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"controller":{"enableSnippets":true}}}'`

# Use Cases

* Test application resilience when specific endpoints are unavailable
* Simulate partial service outages
* Block specific clients identified by HTTP headers

# Rollback

The annotation made to the ingress resource will be removed automatically after the action is finished. If you want to rollback manually, you can look for the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` (or `nginx.org/server-snippets` for Enterprise NGINX) in the ingress resource and remove the parts that are surrounded by `# BEGIN STEADYBIT -` and `# END STEADYBIT -`. The steadybit parts in the annotation will be removed automatically after the action is finished.

# Parameters

Path Pattern, HTTP Method, and HTTP Headers are optional parameters. If you do not set them, nothing will be blocked. If you set them, all requests that match the path pattern, HTTP method, and HTTP headers will be blocked.

| Duration     | true     | How long should the traffic be affected?                                                                                              |
| Status Code  | true     | The status code which should get returned (100-999).                                                                                 |
| Path Pattern | false    | A regex pattern to match the paths to block.                                                                                          |
| HTTP Method  | false    | A http method to match the requests to block. * is used as not set.                                                                   |
| HTTP Headers | false    | A list of HTTP headers to match the requests to block. Value is a regex pattern. If multiple headers are set, all of them must match. |
