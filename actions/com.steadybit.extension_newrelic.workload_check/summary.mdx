# Introduction

When executing chaos experiments, you may want to check the status of a workload in New Relic are popping up. Or the opposite.

The workload check step can be dragged&dropped into the experiment editor. The action needs one or more New Relic workloads to be selected as targets.
Once done, you can use it to collect information about the state of the New Relic workload and, optionally, to verify that they are within the expected condition.

Experiments can be aborted and marked as failed when the workload check's actual state diverges from the expected state.
This helps to implement pre-/post-conditions and invariants.
For example, to only start an experiment when the system is healthy.

# Use Cases

 - Pre-/postcondition or invariant for any experiment.
 - Verify that incidents are triggered during experiments.
