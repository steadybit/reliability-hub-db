# Introduction

This action leverages [steadybit/failure-azure-functions-net](https://github.com/steadybit/failure-azure-functions-net) and the Azure App Configuration to inject status code into an ASP.NET application.

# Use Cases

- Understand how other services respond to an ASP.NET application returning a specific status code.

# Prerequisites

ASP.NET application must use .NET 8 or higher.

ASP.NET application must [be wrapped with the Steadybit Injection Middleware](https://github.com/steadybit/failure-azure-functions-net).

ASP.NET application must have **STEADYBIT_FAILURE_INJECTION_ENDPOINT** environment variable set to the Azure App Configuration endpoint.

Please note that multiple parallel failure injections on the same ASP.NET application are not supported.

# Important Considerations

The default implementation of the Azure App Configuration middleware in .NET is non-blocking. Therefore, the configuration refresh
does not occur in the request where refresh started; instead, it is active from that request onward.

# Parameters

| Parameter   | Description                                                                       | Default |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Duration    | The duration of the attack.                                                       | 30s     |
| Rate        | The rate of invocations to affect. (100 = all request, 50 = half of all requests) | 100%    |
| Status Code | The status code to return.                                                        | 500     |
