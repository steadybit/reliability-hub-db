# Introduction

Stresses a specific amount of memory using ongoing memory allocations, reads and writes.

# Usage

Note that this can cause systems to trip the Linux Kernel OOM killer without enough physical or swap Memory.

> This action uses `stress-ng` to stress the Memory. In addition to memory consumption, due to the ongoing memory allocations, reads, and writes, CPU usage will also increase.
> If not enough CPU is available, then this attack might fail to allocate all specified Memory.

If you want to fill up the Memory without stressing the CPU, use the [Fill Memory](/action/com.steadybit.extension_container.fill_mem) action.

# Use Cases

    * Test the system's ability to handle memory spikes.
    * Observe the system's behavior when it runs out of memory or the memory bandwidth is exhausted.

# Parameters

| Parameter           | Description                                                                  | Default |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Duration            | How long should memory be wasted?                                            | 30s     |
| Load on Host Memory | How much of the **total memory** should be used to stress the memory?        | 80%     |
| Fail on OOM Kill    | Should it be treated as a failure when the attacked container was oomkilled? | False   |
