# Discovery of Postman Collection Targets

Postman collections are discovered to be used as targets for the Postman Collection Run Action.

### Note
The discovery interval is configurable by setting the `STEADYBIT_EXTENSION_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL` environment variable. The default value is 3 hours, because there is a limit of 1000 calls per month in free accounts.
