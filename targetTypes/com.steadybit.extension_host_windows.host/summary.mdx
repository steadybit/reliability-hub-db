# Discovery of Windows Host Targets

The extension's networking attacks are based on the [network driver](https://github.com/steadybit/WinDivert/) provided alongside the extension. The driver is not persistent and is only active during
the duration of the attack. The driver passed all of the [HLK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/) tests, assuring safety.

### Beta Release

Microsoft is in the process of signing the driver; until then, test signing must be enabled on the machine. Check the [installation guide](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-host-windows?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-release-versions) for more information.

* Hostname
