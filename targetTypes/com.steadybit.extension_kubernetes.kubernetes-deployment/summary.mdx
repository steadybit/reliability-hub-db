# Discovery of Kubernetes Deployments

#### Kubernetes API Server

Our agent is able to communicate directly with the `Kubernetes API Server` to get more details about containers and pods. This optional feature can be given to the agents when deploying the `DaemonSet` by setting up a `ServiceAccount` and limit the access by using a `RBAC Authorization`.

Additional information is provided by \`

* Deployments
* ReplicaSets
* StatefulSets
* DaemonSets

Our central platform prepares this additional information and uses it to identify new potential targets. Thus it is possible to attack a dedicated Kubernetes `Deployment` or to cause failures in a `ReplicaSet`.
