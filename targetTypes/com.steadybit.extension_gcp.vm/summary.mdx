# GCP Cloud Discovery

With the GCP / Google Cloud Discovery, you can easily discover cloud resources without having to install agents on every machine.

## GCP Virtual Machine Discovery
The cloud agent will discover all your GCP virtual machines and create a vm target for each one of them.
Virtual Machines of Kubernetes Engine will be discovered as well, when the cluster is created as standard cluster (not autopilot).
