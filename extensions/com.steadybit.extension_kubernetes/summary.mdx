# Introduction

The Kubernetes extension enhances Steadybit's discovery and attack capabilities with Kubernetes-native features for your Kubernetes clusters.
It is the perfect match, no matter whether you want to try out Steadybit in your local minikube or managed Kubernetes like AWS EKS.

The extension is mainly implemented based on `kubectl`-commands and Kubernetes API calls.
It goes hand in hand with the [extension-container](https://hub.steadybit.com/extension/com.steadybit.extension_container), which adds attack and discovery support for containers running in Kubernetes pods.
