# Introduction to the Kubernetes Extension
The Steadybit Kubernetes Extension is designed to integrate seamlessly with your Kubernetes clusters, enhancing them with robust Chaos Engineering capabilities.
Ideal for both local minikube environments and managed Kubernetes services like AWS EKS, this extension is a versatile tool in your reliability toolkit.


# Integration and Functionality
Built on `kubectl`-commands and Kubernetes API calls, the extension ensures a native Kubernetes experience.
It is the perfect match with for the [extension-container](https://hub.steadybit.com/extension/com.steadybit.extension_container), which bolsters attack and discovery functionalities for containers in Kubernetes pods.


# Key Features
1. **Enhanced Discovery**: Uncover intricate details of your Kubernetes clusters. This feature provides a deep dive into [nodes](https://hub.steadybit.com/target/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.kubernetes-node), [pods](https://hub.steadybit.com/target/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.kubernetes-pod), [StatefulSets](https://hub.steadybit.com/target/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.kubernetes-statefulset), [DaemonSets](https://hub.steadybit.com/target/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.kubernetes-daemonset), and more, offering a panoramic view of your deployment.
2. **Advanced Attack Scenarios**: Prepare for real-world disruptions with expanded attack options like [pod deletions](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.delete_pod), [node tainting](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.taint_node)/[draining](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.drain_node), and [inducing CrashLoopBackOff states in pods](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes.crash_loop_pod). These scenarios are crucial for stress-testing and enhancing system resilience.
3. **Extension-Container Synergy**: The extension-container enhances the Kubernetes extension, offering targeted attack and discovery capabilities for pod-contained containers, enabling a more comprehensive Chaos Engineering practice.
4. **Ease of Use**: The extension integrates seamlessly into Steadybit's user-friendly interface to ensure a smooth experience, catering to both beginners and seasoned practitioners in Chaos Engineering.
5. **Versatile Compatibility**: The extension is designed to adapt to various Kubernetes environments, from local setups like minikube to managed services like AWS EKS.
