# Introduction to the Kubernetes Extension
The Steadybit Kubernetes Extension adds support for Chaos Engineering attacks and checks in your Kubernetes clusters. The extension works for local minikube environments and managed Kubernetes clusters, such as AWS EKS.


# Integration and Functionality
The extension uses `kubectl`-commands and Kubernetes API calls to communicate with your cluster. The [extension-container](https://hub.steadybit.com/extension/com.steadybit.extension_container)
and [extension-host](https://hub.steadybit.com/extension/com.steadybit.extension_host) are a good addition to support further attacks and checks in your Kubernetes cluster.

# Installation of the Extension
If you've installed the Steadybit Agent in a Kubernetes cluster using our provided [helm-chart](https://docs.steadybit.com/install-and-configure/install-outpost-agent/install-on-kubernetes#installation), the Kubernetes extension is already installed by default.

Otherwise, you can also use the [helm-chart of the Kubernetes extension](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes#installation) to deploy the extension in your cluster.
