# Introduction to the New Relic Extension
The Steadybit New Relic Extension bridges the world of Steadybit and New Relic.
The extension adds checks to your Chaos Engineering experiments to validate detection of New Relic incidents and the state of workloads.
Furthermore it reports events of your experiments to New Relic to ease correlation.


# Integration and Functionality

## Integration of New Relic in Steadybit

Integration of New Relic into Steadybit works via the New Relic GraphQL API. All you need is an API Key and the base URL of your New Relic API.

With the [Incident Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_newrelic.incident_check) you can integrate your New Relic incidents into your experiments.
Check that your observability strategy is working as expected by verifying that New Relic notices a problem which is injected by Steadybit.

With the [Workload Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_newrelic.workload_check) you can check the state of a workload.

With the [Create Muting Rule](/action/com.steadybit.extension_newrelic.create_muting_rule) you can mute your alerting during an experiment to avoid false alarms and avoid incident processes.


## Integration of Steadybit in New Relic

This type of integration is using the Insight Collector API of New Relic. You need an API Key of Type "LICENSE" and the base URL of your New Relic API.

The extension automatically reports experiment executions to New Relic which helps you to correlate detected incidents in New Relic.

Furthermore, you can [get a dashboard](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-newrelic/tree/main/dashboard) to see amount of experiment executions in your New Relic environment.
