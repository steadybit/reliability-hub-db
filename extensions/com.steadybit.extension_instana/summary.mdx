# Introduction to the Instana Extension
The Steadybit Instana Extension bridges the world of Steadybit and Instana.
The extension adds checks to your Chaos Engineering experiments to validate detection of Instana events.


# Integration and Functionality
Integration of Instana into Steadybit works via the Instana API.
Thus, all you need is an API Key and the base URL of your Instana environment.

## Integration of Instana in Steadybit
With the [Event Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_instana.event_check) you can integrate your Instana events into your experiments.
Check that your observability strategy is working as expected by verifying that Instana notices a problem which is injected by Steadybit.

With the [Create Maintenance Window](/action/com.steadybit.extension_instana.maintenance-window) you can mute your alerting during an experiment to avoid false alarms and avoid incident processes.

# Installation and Setup
To integrate the Instana extension with your environment, follow our [setup guide](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-instana#installation).
