# Introduction

The GCP (Google Cloud Platform) extension bundles various attacks, target discovery, and check capabilities for GCP managed services.

The GCP extension is essentially an adapter for the GCP APIs. It currently only supports a small set of GCP APIs.

# Further Support for Managed Services
While the GCP extension provides integrations to managed services via GCP APIs, we also offer deeper integration for the following services based on the underlying technology.

## Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
Benefit in GKE from the same integration we offer for unmanaged Kubernetes clusters by installing the following extensions in your Kubernetes cluster: [extension-kubernetes](/extension/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes), [extension-container](/extension/com.steadybit.extension_container), [extension-host](/extension/com.steadybit.extension_host).

## Compute Engine
When using Linux-based VMs in GCP, you can also benefit from [extension-host](/extension/com.steadybit.extension_host)'s capabilities.
