# Introduction

With this extension you are able to discover and attack your Windows hosts in different ways, like modifying network traffic or shutting down processes.

The extension's networking attacks are based on the [network driver](https://github.com/steadybit/WinDivert/) provided alongside the extension.
The driver is not persistent and is only active during the duration of the attack.
The driver passed all of the [HLK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/) tests, assuring safety.

### Beta Release

Microsoft is in the process of signing the driver; until then, test signing must be enabled on the machine. Check the [installation guide](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-host-windows?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-release-versions) for more information.
