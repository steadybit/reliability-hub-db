# Introduction

The JMeter extension allows to integrate JMeter Load Tests into Steadybit Experiments.

## Support Multiple JMeter Executions Locations
Optionally, you can activate the extension's support for multiple JMeter execution locations.
Once you have activated it, you can configure available JMeter execution locations for a team via environments and ensure you're always running the JMeter load test from the right internal location.
Multiple JMeter execution locations are especially helpful when you have different load test hardware to support different scales of load test executions.
See [extension-jmeter's readme](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-jmeter) for further information and migration guidelines.
