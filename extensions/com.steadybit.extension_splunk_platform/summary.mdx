# Introduction to the Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Enterprise Extension
The Steadybit Splunk Platform Extension bridges the world of Steadybit and Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Enterprise.

The extension discovers Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Enterprise Alerts and allows to check their state during experiments.

# Integration and Functionality
Integration of Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Enterprise into Steadybit works via the [Splunk REST API](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTprolog).
The extension requires a Splunk [Access Token](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/Setupauthenticationwithtokens) to use the REST API.

There may be extra steps to access Splunk Cloud Platform. Details are available on the
[Access requirements and limitations for the Splunk Cloud Platform REST API](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTTUT/RESTandCloud) documentation page.

## Integration in Steadybit
With the [Alert Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_splunk_platform.alert.check) you can integrate Splunk Alerts into experiments and verify
that a Splunk Alert was fired due to other actions in your experiment.

# Installation and Setup
