# Introduction to the Kafka Extension
The Steadybit Kafka Extension allows you to create chaos and simultaneously check the behavior of your consumer groups.

# Integration and Functionality
Integration of Kafka into Steadybit works via the [franz-go](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/tree/master) client library.
The extension-kafka utilizes these capabilities and may require elevated rights on the Kafka side to:
- List brokers, topics, consumer groups, and offsets
- Elect leaders for partitions
- Alter broker configurations
- Create and delete ACLs
- Delete records

## Integration of Kafka in Steadybit

Alter Broker configuration in various ways:
- Reduce the max batch size of messages
- Limit the IO/Network threads per broker
- Limit the rate of creation of new connections

You can also run these actions:
- Elect new leaders for partitions
- Produce records either with a fixed amount or with a fixed rate per second
- Deny access to a topic for a consumer
- Trigger a delete record request

In parallel, you can check:
- The current lag of a topic for a consumer group
- The state of a consumer group
