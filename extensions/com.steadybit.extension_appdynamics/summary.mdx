# Introduction to the AppDynamics Extension
The Steadybit AppDynamics Extension bridges the world of Steadybit and AppDynamics.
The extension adds checks to your Chaos Engineering experiments to validate AppDynamics Health rules state and reports events of your experiments to AppDynamics [as custom events to ease correlation](https://docs.appdynamics.com/appd/23.x/latest/en/appdynamics-essentials/monitor-events#id-.MonitorEventsv23.1-FilterCustomEvents).

# Integration and Functionality
Integration of AppDynamics into Steadybit works via the AppDynamics API.
Thus, all you need is a AppDynamics's [Access token](https://docs.appdynamics.com/appd/23.x/latest/en/extend-appdynamics/appdynamics-apis/api-clients).

## Integration of AppDynamics in Steadybit
With the [Health Rule Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_appdynamics.health-rule.check) you can integrate your AppDynamics health rules into your experiments.
Verify that AppDynamics health rules notice a fault injected by Steadybit to check that your observability strategy is working as expected.

## Integration of Steadybit in AppDynamics
The extension reports experiment executions to AppDynamics if an Application Event ID (A manually created Steadybit App is sufficient), which helps you to correlate experiments with your dashboards.

# Installation and Setup
To integrate the AppDynamics extension with your environment, follow our [setup guide](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-appdynamics#installation).
