# Introduction to the Splunk Extension
The Steadybit Splunk Extension bridges the world of Steadybit and Splunk Observability Cloud.
The extension adds checks to your Chaos Engineering experiments to validate Splunk Detector / SLO state and reports events of your experiments to Splunk [as custom events to ease correlation](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/metrics-and-metadata/view-data-events.html#custom-events).

# Integration and Functionality
Integration of Splunk into Steadybit works via the Splunk Observability Cloud API.
Thus, all you need is a Splunk's [Access Token](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/admin/authentication/authentication-tokens/tokens.html) with api and ingest permissions.

## Integration of Splunk in Steadybit
With the [Detector Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_splunk.detector.check) and [SLO Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_splunk.slo.check) you can integrate your Splunk detectors/SLOs into your experiments.
Verify that the Splunk Detector or SLO notice a fault injected by Steadybit to check that your observability strategy is working as expected.

## Integration of Steadybit in Splunk
The extension automatically reports experiment executions to Splunk Observability Cloud, which helps you to correlate experiments with your dashboards.
Furthermore, you can [get a dashboard](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-splunk/tree/main/dashboard) to see amount of experiment executions in your Splunk environment.

# Installation and Setup
To integrate the Splunk extension with your environment, follow our [setup guide](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-splunk#installation).
