# Introduction

With this extension, you can check your HTTP endpoints for availability and response time.
You can also check the response body for specific strings or validate the response time.

You need to deploy the extension in your system, which allows users to easily validate non-public URLs.
For instance, you can check Kubernetes internal URLs or validate URLs requiring a VPN connection otherwise.

## Support Multiple Client Locations
Optionally, you can activate the extension's support for multiple client locations.
Once you have activated it, you can configure available client locations for a team via environments and ensure you're always running the HTTP check from the right internal location to verify non-public URLs.
See [extension-http's readme](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-http) for further information and migration guidelines.
