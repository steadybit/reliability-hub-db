# Introduction

The Azure (cloud computing platform run by Microsoft) extension bundles attack, target discovery for Azure managed services.

The Azure extension is essentially an adapter for the Azure APIs. It currently only supports a small set of Azure APIs.

# Further Support for Managed Services
While the Azure extension provides integrations to managed services via Azure APIs, we also offer deeper integration for the following services based on the underlying technology.

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Benefit in AKS from the same integration we offer for unmanaged Kubernetes clusters by installing the following extensions in your Kubernetes cluster: [extension-kubernetes](/extension/com.steadybit.extension_kubernetes), [extension-container](/extension/com.steadybit.extension_container), [extension-host](/extension/com.steadybit.extension_host).

## Azure Virtual Machines
When using Linux-based VMs in Azure, you can also benefit from [extension-host](/extension/com.steadybit.extension_host)'s capabilities.
