# Introduction to the Datadog Extension
The Steadybit Datadog Extension bridges the world of Steadybit and Datadog.
The extension adds checks to your Chaos Engineering experiments to validate Datadog monitor's status and reports events of your experiments to Datadog to ease correlation.


# Integration and Functionality
Integration of Datadog into Steadybit works via the Datadog API.
Thus, all you need is Datadog's API and Application Key, along with Datadog's site configuration.

## Integration of Datadog in Steadybit
With the [Monitor Status Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_datadog.monitor.status_check) you can integrate your Datadog monitors into your experiments.
Check that your observability strategy is working as expected by verifying that Datadog monitors notice a fault injected by Steadybit.

With the [Create Downtime Action](/action/com.steadybit.extension_datadog.monitor.downtime) you can mute your monitors during an experiment to avoid false alarms and avoid incident processes.

## Integration of Steadybit in Datadog
The extension automatically reports experiment executions to Datadog which helps you to correlate detected anomalies in Datadog.
Furthermore, you can get a dashboard to see amount of experiment executions by installing Steadybit's [Datadog integration](https://app.datadoghq.eu/integrations/steadybit).

# Installation and Setup
To integrate the Datadog extension with your environment, follow our [setup guide](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-datadog#installation).
