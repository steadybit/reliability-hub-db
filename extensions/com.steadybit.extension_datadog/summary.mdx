# Introduction

The Datadog extension bridges the world of Steadybit and Datadog.
Specifically, it allows the usage of Datadog monitors within Steadybit and events are reported back to Datadog whenever a chaos engineering experiment is active.

## Integration of DataDog in Steadybit
With the [Monitor Status Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_datadog.monitor.status_check) you can integrate your DataDog monitors into your experiments.
Check that your observability strategy is working as expected by verifying that DataDog monitors notice a fault injected by Steadybit.

With the [Create Downtime Action](/action/com.steadybit.extension_datadog.monitor.downtime) you can do exactly the opposite. You can mute your monitors during an experiment to avoid false alarms.

## Integration of Steadybit in DataDog
The extension automatically reports experiment executions to DataDog which helps you to correlate detected anomalies in DataDog.
Furthermore, you can get a dashboard to see amount of experiment executions by installing Steadybit's [DataDog integration](https://app.datadoghq.eu/integrations/steadybit).


# Introduction to the Datadog Extension
The Steadybit Datadog Extension bridges the world of Steadybit and Datadog.
The extension seamlessly integrates with your Datadog monitors by providing valuable checks for your Chaos Engineering experiments and reporting events of your experiments to Datadog to ease correlation.


# Integration and Functionality
Integration of Datadog into Steadybit works via the Datadog API. Thus, all you need is Datadog's API and Application Key, along with Datadog's site configuration.

# Key Features
1. **Advanced Experiments**:
Harden your Datadog configuration by validating that Datadog detects turbulent conditions, injected by using one of [Steadybit attacks](https://hub.steadybit.com/actions?targetType=&kind=attack&extension=&category=), with a [Monitor Status Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_datadog.monitor.status_check) and avoid escalation of on-call procedures by [creating a Downtime](/action/com.steadybit.extension_datadog.monitor.downtime).
Validation of your observability is crucial for enhancing system resilience.
2. **Enhanced Visibility**:
Correlate monitored effects of Datadog easily with executed experiments by getting Steadybit events into Datadog. Quickly validate that the cause of a monitor alert was an experiment to avoid confusion.
3. **Monitor rollouts** Responsible for rolling out Chaos Engineering into your organization, and you miss to see whether the provided platform is working as expected? Benefit by monitoring events in Datadog and, e.g., noticing a peak of experiment errors.
4. **Ease of Use**: The extension integrates seamlessly into Steadybit's user-friendly interface to ensure a smooth experience, catering to beginners and seasoned Chaos Engineering practitioners.
