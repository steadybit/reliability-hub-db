# Introduction

The Gatling extension allows to integrate Gatling Load Tests into Steadybit Experiments.

## Gatling Enterprise Support
The extension supports running Gatling load tests in your Gatling Enterprise account. It requires a valid Gatling Enterprise account and the corresponding API key.

## Local executions
Besides running Gatling load tests in your Gatling Enterprise account, the extension also supports running Gatling load tests locally, in the pod where the extension is installed.

## Support Multiple Gatling Executions Locations
Optionally, you can activate the extension's support for multiple Gatling execution locations.
Once you have activated it, you can configure available Gatling execution locations for a team via environments and ensure you're always running the Gatling load test from the right internal location.
Multiple Gatling execution locations are especially helpful when you have different load test hardware to support different scales of load test executions.
See [extension-gatling's readme](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-gatling) for further information and migration guidelines.
