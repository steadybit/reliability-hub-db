# Introduction

The K6 extension allows to integrate K6 Load Tests into Steadybit Experiments. Local Test or Test using K6 Cloud are supported.

## Support Multiple k6 Executions Locations
Optionally, you can activate the extension's support for multiple k6 execution locations.
Once you have activated it, you can configure available k6 execution locations for a team via environments and ensure you're always running the k6 load test from the right internal location.
Multiple k6 execution locations are especially helpful when you have different load test hardware to support different scales of load test executions.
See [extension-k6's readme](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-k6) for further information and migration guidelines.
