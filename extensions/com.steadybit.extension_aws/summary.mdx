# Introduction

The AWS (Amazon Web Services) extension bundles various attack, target discovery, and check capabilities for the AWS product pallet.
For example, you can use the AWS extension to change the state of EC2 instances, trigger reboot or failover for RDS instances, mess around with ECS tasks and services, or inject failures into lambdas.

The AWS extension is, in essence, an adapter for the AWS APIs.
If you need additional capabilities, please consider contributing these directly via GitHub.

To set up the extension and the needed IAM permissions, please consult the [steadybit/extension-aws/README.md](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-aws/blob/main/README.md)
