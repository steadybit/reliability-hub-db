# Introduction to the Dynatrace Extension
The Steadybit Dynatrace Extension bridges the world of Steadybit and Dynatrace.
The extension adds checks to your Chaos Engineering experiments to validate detection of Dynatrace problems and reports events of your experiments to Dynatrace to ease correlation.


# Integration and Functionality
Integration of Dynatrace into Steadybit works via the Dynatrace API.
Thus, all you need is an API Token and the API base URL of your Dynatrace environment.

## Integration of Dynatrace in Steadybit
With the [Problem Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_dynatrace.problem_check) you can integrate your Dynatrace problems into your experiments.
Check that your observability strategy is working as expected by verifying that Dynatrace notices a problem which is injected by Steadybit.

With the [Create Maintenance Window](/action/com.steadybit.extension_dynatrace.create_maintenance_window) you can mute your alerting during an experiment to avoid false alarms and avoid incident processes.

## Integration of Steadybit in Dynatrace
The extension automatically reports experiment executions to Dynatrace which helps you to correlate detected anomalies in Dynatrace.
Furthermore, you can [get a dashboard](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-dynatrace/tree/main/dashboard) to see amount of experiment executions in your Dynatrace environment.


# Installation and Setup
To integrate the Dynatrace extension with your environment, follow our [setup guide](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-dynatrace#installation).
