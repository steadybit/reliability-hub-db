# Introduction

The Dynatrace extension bridges the world of Steadybit and Dynatrace.
Steadybit events are reported to Dynatrace whenever a chaos engineering experiment is active.

## Integration of Steadybit in Dynatrace
The extension automatically reports experiment executions to Dynatrace which helps you to correlate detected anomalies in Dynatrace.
Furthermore, you can [get a dashboard](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-dynatrace/tree/main/dashboard) to see the amount of experiment executions directly in your Dynatrace instance.
