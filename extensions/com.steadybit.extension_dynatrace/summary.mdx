# Introduction to the Dynatrace Extension
The Steadybit Dynatrace Extension bridges the world of Steadybit and Dynatrace. The extension seamlessly integrates with your Dynatrace monitoring by providing valuable checks for your Chaos Engineering experiments and reporting events of your experiments to Dynatrace to ease correlation.


# Integration and Functionality
Integration of Dynatrace into Steadybit works via the Dynatrace API. Thus, all you need is an API Token and the API base URL of your Dynatrace environment.

# Key Features
1. **Advanced Experiments**:
Harden your Dynatrace configuration by validating that Dynatrace detects turbulent conditions, injected by using one of [Steadybit attacks](https://hub.steadybit.com/actions?targetType=&kind=attack&extension=&category=), with a [problem check](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_dynatrace.problem_check) and avoid escalation of on-call procedures by [creating a maintenance window](https://hub.steadybit.com/action/com.steadybit.extension_dynatrace.create_maintenance_window). Validation of your observability is crucial for enhancing system resilience.
2. **Enhanced Visibility**:
Correlate monitored effects of Dynatrace easily with executed experiments by getting Steadybit events into Dynatrace. Quickly validate that the cause of a problem was an experiment to avoid confusion.
3. **Monitor rollouts** Responsible for rolling out Chaos Engineering into your organization, and you miss to see whether the provided platform is working as expected? Benefit by monitoring events in Dynatrace and, e.g., noticing a peak of experiment errors.
4. **Ease of Use**: The extension integrates seamlessly into Steadybit's user-friendly interface to ensure a smooth experience, catering to beginners and seasoned Chaos Engineering practitioners.
