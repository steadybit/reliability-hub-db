# Introduction to the Grafana Extension
The Steadybit Grafana Extension bridges the world of Steadybit and Grafana.
The extension adds checks to your Chaos Engineering experiments to validate Grafana Alert rules state and reports events of your experiments to Grafana [as annotations to ease correlation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/annotate-visualizations/).

# Integration and Functionality
Integration of Grafana into Steadybit works via the Grafana API.
Thus, all you need is a Grafana's [Service Account Token](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/create-api-tokens-for-org/).

## Integration of Grafana in Steadybit
With the [Alert Rule Check](/action/com.steadybit.extension_grafana.alert-rule.check) you can integrate your Grafana alert rules into your experiments.
Verify that Grafana alert rules notice a fault injected by Steadybit to check that your observability strategy is working as expected.

## Integration of Steadybit in Grafana
The extension automatically reports experiment executions to Grafana, which helps you to correlate experiments with your dashboards.

# Installation and Setup
